1>Conditional code Execution
 if keyword starts condition
 A: ends the condition 
ex:
num = 5
if num % 2 == 0:
	print("Number is Even")
else:
	print("Number is odd")

we have AND and OR operator 
ex 
if a>10 and b<43: it will chack both the condition 
if a>44 of b<2: it will chack only one qustion 

for Syntax
	for i in range (number):

while syntax

	i = 10 --->initialization
	while i>=0:  --->condition 
		print(i)
		i -= 0 --->increment and decrement
